    description:
      "In developing the Canteen Management System, I designed the data schema and developed server-side logic to handle various functionalities. Implementing JWT-based authentication ensured secure access for different user roles. I designed and managed the database, including data modeling and queries for efficient data retrieval. I created robust logic for handling user orders, optimized for different roles, enhancing the ordering process. The UI was built using MUI components, providing a modern and consistent look. I also created reusable components for both the canteen users and administrators. For state management and data manipulation, I utilized React core packages like Redux and RTK, along with Yup for validation and Formik for form state management. Additionally, I rigorously tested and validated APIs using tools like Postman and Insomnia to ensure reliability and functionality.",
